\section{The Reality of Complex Conjugates}
As I develop more mathematical maturity, I have learned how to 'play' with new concepts to both make and prove a wider variety of observations. One example is when I learned about the modulus/argument form of complex numbers. The ease they provide when performing rotations in the 2D plane and connection they show between fundamental mathematical constants fascinate me.
When I first learned how to express a complex number in modululs-argument form, I immediately tried to derive an expression for their conjugates on my own. I realized that all aspects of a complex number and its conjugate in modulus-argument form are the same except their angles, which are additive inverses.
